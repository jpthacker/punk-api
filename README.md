## user story

- As a user of the Punk API website, I want to be able to view, search and filter Brewdog's back catalogue of beers, so that I can select an appropriate beer.
- Given that I am on the website and I have not clicked or adjusted the filters and/or entered a term into the searchbar, when I view the homepage, I would like to see all the beers available.
- Given that I am looking for a specific beer, when I enter the correct term into the searchbar, the appropriate beer should be displayed benearth the search bar.
